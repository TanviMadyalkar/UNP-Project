# UNP-Project
Finished the above projects as part of my Data Science Internship Program from United Nations pf Professionals (UNP) 
Main takeaways :
 ~ For the Credit risk dataset, we performed six types of machine learning algorithms: Logistic
       Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification, SVM, K-NN and K-means.
 ~ For the Concrete dataset, we performed five types of machine learning algorithms: Linear
       Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, SVM and K-NN.
